# SwiftGodot 3D Platformer Starter Kit

This repository is a modified version of the [3D Platformer Starter Kit](https://github.com/KenneyNL/Starter-Kit-3D-Platformer) originally created by Kenney, adapted to showcase the usage of [SwiftGodot](https://github.com/migueldeicaza/SwiftGodot) for developing in Godot.

## Goal

The primary aim of this project is to provide a complete Godot project written entirely in Swift using SwiftGodot that other gamedevs can use to learn from.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the ___source___ directory in your terminal.
2. Run the command `swift build` to build the project.
3. After the build is complete, locate the dynamic libraries:
   - `libPlatformer3D.dylib`
   - `libSwiftGodot.dylib`
4. Copy these libraries to the ___bin___ directory located in the root of the project.
5. Once the libraries are copied, you can open the project in Godot.

Now you're ready to explore the code and run the game!
